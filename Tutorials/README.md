### Step 1
**Step 1:** is the faceplate which is optional. Once can also make a custom case, 3D printed case, or something w/ a CNC machine. The sky is the limit for really creative and well designed enclosures.

Following this design template of a 12"*12" aluminum piece of metal, make the rectangular cuts. Drill the six rivet holes and four holes seen on the template. This will help with attaching the bill acceptor.

If you were to make the case; \
Cut two aluminum angles into 11 1/2″ lengths (as per original instructions). \
Drill/[tap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tap_and_die#mediaviewer/File:Tap_and_T-wrench.jpg) two holes, and drill three rivet holes for the faceplate. (See diagram to avoid confusion).

Remember to rivet the two aluminum angles. You will need to rivet them to the sides of the flaceplate. Make sure to allow for (about 1/8″) room to overlap the surface at the front of the box (as per instructions). The angles should be positioned to lie inside the box.
