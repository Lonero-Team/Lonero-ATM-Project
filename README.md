# Lonero ATM Project
![LoneroATM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mentors4EDU/Images/master/LoneroATM.png)

The **Lonero ATM Project** is a fork of [openbitcoinatm](https://openbitcoinatm.wordpress.com/), but for the concept of Lonero. Part of the reason this was made was seeing projects like [Bitstop](https://bitstop.co/), inspired us to want to create something open source that would make Lonero more accessible. Please keep in mind this is intended for educational usecases and aspects only. Please keep in mind regulatory laws, and that ATM or crypto businesses may need a [Money Transmitter License](https://dilendorf.com/blockchain-crypto/money-transmitter-licensing.html). Also please keep in mind this crypto is a utility, and this repo as well as community hardware project is primarily intended for educational purposes.
